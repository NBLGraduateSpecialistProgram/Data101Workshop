# Data101
So youâ€™ve finally assembled or gotten your hands on a dataset or spreadsheet. Nice work! Not sure what to do next? These materials form a workshop on data organization, manipulation, and analysis for beginners, using [the dplyr package in R](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/).

This workshop was originally offered during the Fall 2018 semester at Rutgers University-New Brunswick through the [New Brunswick Libraries Graduate Specialists program](https://libguides.rutgers.edu/graduatespecialist/) and the [Rutgers DH Initiative](http://dh.rutgers.edu/).

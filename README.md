# Data101
So youâ€™ve finally assembled or gotten your hands on a dataset or spreadsheet. Nice work! Not sure what to do next? These materials form a basic introductory workshop on data organization and manipulation, using [the dplyr package in R](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) and data from the [What Middletown Read Project](https://lib.bsu.edu/wmr/).

This workshop was originally offered during April 2018 at Rutgers University-New Brunswick through the [New Brunswick Libraries Graduate Specialists program](https://libguides.rutgers.edu/graduatespecialist/) and the [Rutgers DH Initiative](http://dh.rutgers.edu/).

# Data101
So youâ€™ve finally assembled or gotten your hands on a dataset or spreadsheet. Nice work! Not sure what to do next? These materials form a basic introductory workshop on data organization and manipulation, using (the dplyr package in R)[https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/] and data from the (What Middletown Read Project)[https://lib.bsu.edu/wmr/].

This workshop was originally offered during April 2018 at Rutgers University-New Brunswick through the (New Brunswick Libraries Graduate Specialists program)[https://libguides.rutgers.edu/graduatespecialist/] and the (Rutgers DH Initiative)[http://dh.rutgers.edu/].
